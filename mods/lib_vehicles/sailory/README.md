A makeover of the sailboat from the sailing mod. This version is more
modular and does not have hard dependencies that are not included in the modpack.

### How to use
* Jump: Put up or take down the sails
* Left, right: turn the boat
* Sneak + left or right: turn the sail

The flag above the sail shows the direction of the wind.
Right click the boat with dye to dye the flag or the sail:
If the sail is up, the sail is dyed, otherwise the flag.
